<h1>The call for proposals for the AoN Brainhack Warsaw 2017 is now open!</h1>

<p>On the weekend of <strong>17-19th November 2017</strong>, the first edition of <strong>AoN Brainhack Warsaw</strong> will take place. During this two-day event dedicated to students and PhD students, we will work in teams on <strong>neuroscience-related projects</strong>.</p>

<p>The aim of the event is to meet new, enthusiastic researchers, make new friendships in academia, learn, share the knowledge on data mining and brain research, but also promote open science in the spirit of the whole Brainhack community <a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13742-016-0121-x">(Craddock et al., 2016)</a>.
